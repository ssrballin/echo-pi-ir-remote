# echo-pi-ir-remote
RaspberryPi IR remote that can be controlled via an Amazon Echo.

This was a simple project that used a raspberry pi and an IR bulb to communicate with my home theater setup. The raspberry pi communicated with the Amazon Echo through a custom API to allow the controlling of my home theater via flexible voice commands.
